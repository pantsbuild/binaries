binaries
========

A home for scripts that build pants static binaries.


Supported Platforms
===================

As of Spring 2018, binaries are no longer being published for i386 nor macOS versions prior to 10.8.
Binaries for Linux x86_64 and macOS 10.8+ are generally published.

workflow
========

The general workflow for publishing new binaries is:

1. Create a script that will build the binary tool as reproducibly as possible, and place
   the script in a relevant directory under `build-support`. For example, for `thrift` `0.10.0` for `mac`,
   you'd create the script at `build-support/bin/thrift/mac/10.13/0.10.0/build.sh`. The script should place the built binary in the current directory upon success so that the reviewer doesn't have to find and move it after running the build script.
2. Symlink the script directory into all other relevant versions for both platforms (see [supported platforms](#supported-platforms)). Currently this only needs to be done for OSX. If `10.13` is the current OSX version, from within e.g. `build-support/bin/thrift/mac`, run `ln -s 10.13 10.12`, and so forth (e.g. `ln -s 10.13 10.11`) for all supported previous OSX versions.
3. Get the script and links reviewed. During review, the reviewer should confirm that the script
   successfully produces a binary on their machine(s).
4. The script should then be merged _without_ the produced binaries.
5. After merging, the reviewer should (re-)execute the script (if necessary), confirm that binaries
   have been created in all relevant symlinked directories, and then run:
     ```
     ./sync-s3.sh
     ```
  ...to upload the produced binaries to s3.

building

linux
-----

*Requires [docker](https://www.docker.com/).*

1. Change directories to the root of this repository, and run:
  ```
  docker run -v "$(pwd):/pantsbuild-binaries" -w '/pantsbuild-binaries' --rm -it pantsbuild/centos7:latest /bin/bash
  ```
  ...to pop yourself in a controlled image back at this repo's root.

2. Change into the directory containing the `build-*.sh` script corresponding to the binary you wish to build.
3. Run the `build-*.sh` script -- the binary should be location in the script's directory upon success.

osx
---

We have no controlled build environment solution like we do for linux, so you'll need to get your hands on an OSX machine.  With that in hand:

1. Change into the directory containing the `build-*.sh` script corresponding to the binary you wish to build.
2. Run the `build-*.sh` script -- the binary should be location in the script's directory upon success.
